- Chapter 5
  - [Wallace Stevens, "The Idea of Order at Key West"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43431/the-idea-of-order-at-key-west)

## (->) (i.e., "function arrow" or "function type constructor")

- [Where can I read up on the haskell “->” operator?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9136421/where-can-i-read-up-on-the-haskell-operator)

- [Monads, Arrows and Idioms (on Philip Wadler's homepage)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html)

- *"Function arrows (i.e.,-> operator) associate to the right, but function application is left associative"*
  - [Explanation with concrete examples](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30440377/usefulness-of-function-arrows-associate-to-the-right)

## NoMonoMorphism language extension

## Parametricity

## Miscellaneous

- [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)
  - *"Hoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type signature."* For example, look up [`Int -> String`](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=Int+-%3E+String)

- [The most general way to convert any type to `String` (Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2784271/haskell-converting-int-to-string)

- [What is associativity of operators and why is it important?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/930486/what-is-associativity-of-operators-and-why-is-it-important)

- [Haskell: `where` vs `let` (Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4362328/haskell-where-vs-let)

- [What's the point of `const`? (Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7402528/whats-the-point-of-const-in-the-haskell-prelude)
  - Probably more useful in later chapters
